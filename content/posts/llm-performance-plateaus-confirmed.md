## 📖 Research nugget  

Top DeepMind veterans **David Silver** and **Richard Sutton** argue that large-language-model progress is *stalling* because we've exhausted high-quality text data, as highlighted in their "Welcome to the Era of Experience" [paper](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/wisereads/articles/welcome-to-the-era-of-experien/The_Era_of_Experience_Paper_pCPD9bW.pdf). 

They argue that the to get to superintelligence AI agents must learn from experience.
