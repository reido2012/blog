My girlfriend got me a Bambu Lab AI mini 3D Printer for my birthday! 

It was pretty easy to setup - It looks more scary than it actually is. 

The calibration took about 20 mins - but it was all automatic so I was just watching it lol

In under an hour I was able to produce the small boat everyone prints first. It's the 'hello world' of 3D printing.
