## Reclaiming the Future: Dr Timnit Gebru on Hyper-local AI

Podcast: [Honoring our elders with Dr Timnit Gebru](https://www.techpolicy.press/through-to-thriving-honoring-our-elders-with-dr-timnit-gebru/)

### Why it matters
- Supports my hypothesis that startups can beat hyperscalers and big tech when they own context
- Reinforces my framework: imagination = power; decentralise it.

### Highlights

> "We are living in someone else's imagination."

Dr Gebru argues that Silicon Valley's monopoly on "future imagination" sidelines most communities. DAIR is shifting from critique to building alternative futures.

**Hyper-local AI**: Tools focused on Ethiopian or Eritrean languages (Lesan) outperform Big Tech because creators *know the context and care about users.*

**Federation vision** — A mesh of language-specific AI firms can outcompete monoliths as unique, high-quality data plus commoditised open-source LLMs level the playing field. Hyperscalers spent the money; we now have models and tools to serve any niche.

**Knowledge gap**: 84% of Wikipedia articles target Europe & North America; lack of tooling blocks editors in other languages.

### Takeaways
- Federated micro-AI firms outperform Big Tech when they own context.
- Wikipedia's language gap shows the same power asymmetry.

### Further Questions

How can we practice imagining alternative futures? 
How do we fund non VC scale technical projects?
