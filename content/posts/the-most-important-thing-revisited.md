**TLDR**

* Think deeper than consensus and act only when you have a *correct* non-consensus view. 
* Buy below *intrinsic value* so you always have a **margin of safety**. ([CFA Institute Blogs][2])
* Risk is the chance of permanent loss, not day-to-day price swings.
* Hold until price converges with value or walk away. Markets can stay irrational for a long time.

## Crypto backdrop

The GENIUS Act, signed on **18 Jul 2025**, has pushed fresh money into the space by giving stablecoins a clear legal lane, so prices across the board have spiked. ([Reuters][5]) That excitement, plus wider hopes for pro-business policies, is tempting a new wave of FOMO buyers. ([Barron's][6])

If you admit you're just speculating, more power to you. But data on tens of thousands of retail accounts shows that short-term trading usually under-performs buy-and-hold strategies. ([currentmarketvaluation.com][7])

## XRP sanity check

1. **Intrinsic value** – What real-world utility, cash-flow analogue or fee stream underpins XRP?
2. **Mispricing** – Where and why is consensus wrong?
3. **Margin of safety** – Is today's price far enough below that intrinsic value?
4. **Risk range** – What events could create a *permanent* loss?
   No clear answers → pass.

## Howard Marks playbook (five-chapter flash)

| #   | Idea                             | Key note                                                                                  |
| --- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Second-level thinking**        | Beat the market with correct, non-consensus insight *and* the conviction to act.          |
| 2   | **Misperception = edge**         | Inefficiency plus skill creates opportunity; you need both.                               |
| 3   | **Intrinsic value + conviction** | Know what it's worth, buy cheap, hold while the world catches up.                         |
| 4   | **Price is everything**          | "No asset is so good it can't become a bad investment at the wrong price."                |
| 5   | **Real risk**                    | Bigger headline risk does **not** guarantee bigger reward; focus on downside permanence.  |

## My full notes on *The Most Important Thing* by Howard Marks

### Introduction – Know thy market

* The market environment is the playing field that investing takes place so be aware of what is going on in the world and what results of events lead to in the market.
* Staying alert lets you build mental models. When a rhyme shows up in history, you either act immediately or buy time to figure out the best move.

### Chapter 1 – Second-level thinking

> Extraordinary performance can only come from correct non consensus forecasts regarding value.

* You can't take the same actions as everyone else and expect to outperform.
* One's investment approach should be intuitive and adaptive because economics is not an exact science.
* Aim for **absolute**, not relative, return.
* Extraordinary performance can only come from correct non consensus forecasts regarding value.
* Successful investors must think at a higher level to develop unique insight (Second Level Thinking).
  * *Example*: The Big Short – Michael Burry's mortgage bet required insight *and* stamina in the face of backlash.
* Use the Asset Evaluation Checklist. See the bottom of the article.
* Successful investors must react and behave at a higher level to maximise reward generated from unique insight.

### Chapter 2 – Misperception is opportunity

> "**If riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns, they wouldn't be riskier.**"

* Markets **can** misprice assets; inefficiency is real but cyclical.
* Second-level thinkers mine these gaps for alpha.
* **Instances of misperception provide edge** – the messier and more complex the arena, the more room to know something others don't.
* Prices often reflect consensus instantly—but consensus can be wrong.
* Always map incentives; they signal likely behaviour and outcomes.

### Chapter 3 – Intrinsic value & conviction

* Rigorous valuation underpins value investing.
* Do not be afraid to look wrong most of the time—it can take a while to be proven right.
* **Margin of safety = Intrinsic value − market price**.
* Biggest gains: buy underpriced, average down with conviction, *and be right*.

### Chapter 4 – Price over pedigree

> "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent." - Keynes

> A strong view of intrinsic value provides the conviction needed to wait for the market to agree with you.

* It starts with **price** and ends with **value**.
* Buy at the deepest discount you can.
* "If your estimate of intrinsic value is correct, price should converge with value over time."
* No asset is inherently good or bad; it's all about entry price.
* Short-term psychology can yank prices anywhere.
* Do not buy an asset at the peak of its popularity; instead buy an asset when nobody likes it.
* Price moves toward value when the market wakes up. No luck is required.

### Chapter 5 – Risk, properly defined

* Risk means uncertainty about which outcome will occur and about the possibility of loss when the unfavorable ones do.
* Higher *quoted* risk doesn't guarantee higher return.
* Great investors **understand, identify and control** risk.
* Think about the future as a range of possibilities to gauge downside likelihood.
* Unlikely outcomes happen all the time; the future rarely mirrors the past.
* Risk tolerance is personal. Tailor exposure to your circumstances.


Asset Evaluation Checklist
- What is the range of likely future outcomes?
- Which outcome do I think will occur?
- What's the probability I'm right?
- What does the consensus think?
- How does my expectation differ from the consensus?
- How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine?
- Is the consensus psychology that's incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?
- What will happen to the asset's price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I'm right?"
