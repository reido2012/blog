## 🛠️ Build progress (Dev Diary)  
```text
✔ Downloaded customer data from Xano → CSV  
✔ Cleaned duplicates & formatting issues  
✔ Spun up timestamped Turso DB and imported data successfully  
➜ Next: validate new DB with the Shunyaku service and add scripts to swap production secrets
The pipeline reached the "import succeeded" stage this evening after fixing a customer-ID mismatch.
```
